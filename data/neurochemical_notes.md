### Cortisol Interpretability Notes

**Cortisol** is a steroid hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stress. Often called the *“stress hormone,”* it plays a key role in the body’s **fight-or-flight** response, regulating energy availability, inflammation, and alertness under pressure.

#### 🔺 High Cortisol Values

Elevated cortisol levels typically indicate **activation of the stress response** — whether physical, emotional, or psychological. These states often involve **anxiety, fear, vigilance, social threat, or cognitive overload**.

In the dataset, examples of emotions with **high cortisol** include:

* `fear`, `perplexity`, `suspicion`, and `schadenfreude` — signaling social tension, uncertainty, or aversion.
* `sadness`, `wistfulness`, and `drive` — which reflect inner turbulence, unresolved desire, or persistent striving.
* `kinship` — interestingly high, perhaps pointing to the **emotional vulnerability** of attachment and care.

These profiles suggest a mobilization of internal resources — to defend, pursue, or process something significant.

#### 🔻 Low Cortisol Values

Lower cortisol levels generally reflect **calm, relief, or restoration** — states in which the nervous system is more regulated and the body is not under perceived threat.

In this dataset, emotions with **low cortisol** include:

* `gratitude`, `bliss`, and `relief` — which align with safety, peace, and psychological release.
* `remorse` and `synergy` — which may involve **reflective or reconciliatory states**, not marked by outward agitation.
* `anger` — counterintuitively low in cortisol here, suggesting certain expressions of anger may be **energizing** or cathartic without necessarily being stressful.

These emotions tend to support **recovery, bonding, or meaning-making**, rather than emergency response.

### 🧬 Why This Matters

Understanding cortisol values helps frame each emotional profile not just by how it **feels**, but by what it **demands of the body**. In combination with other chemicals like **dopamine**, **serotonin**, **oxytocin**, and **norepinephrine**, cortisol offers insight into:

* **Arousal vs. regulation**
* **Threat vs. safety**
* **Effort vs. surrender**
