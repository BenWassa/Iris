### Cortisol Interpretability Notes

**Cortisol:** Often referred to as the "stress hormone," cortisol plays a crucial role in the body's stress response.

*   **High Cortisol Values:** Typically indicate states of stress, fear, anxiety, or high arousal. It is associated with the "fight or flight" response and prolonged activation can have negative health impacts. Emotions like `fear`, `schadenfreude`, `perplexity`, `suspicion`, `sadness`, `wistfulness`, `kinship`, and `drive` show relatively high cortisol levels in the dataset, aligning with this interpretation.
*   **Low Cortisol Values:** Generally suggest states of relaxation, calmness, well-being, or recovery from stress. Very low levels could also indicate fatigue or a dysregulated stress response, but within the context of positive emotions, they often signify tranquility. Emotions like `gratitude`, `anger`, `remorse`, `relief`, `bliss`, and `synergy` show lower cortisol levels in the dataset, suggesting less physiological stress.
