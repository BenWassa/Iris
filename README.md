# 🌈 Project Iris

**A poetic, science-informed tool to *see* your mind’s chemistry.**

## 📌 What is Iris?

**Project Iris** transforms your inner neurochemical “cocktail” into a *living emotional map*.  
Adjust sliders for **dopamine**, **oxytocin**, **serotonin**, and **cortisol** — watch your emotional dot drift across a **Valence–Arousal–Dominance** canvas, with colours and motion that mirror your state.

No clinical promises — just a creative mirror for reflection and self-awareness.

## 🧬 Core Idea

> 🧭 *Neurochemistry in → Emotion out → Visual feedback → Reflection.*

**Why?**  
- Neurochemicals modulate felt states.
- Felt states cluster in a 2–3D emotion space.
- Spatial mapping + colour + motion = intuitive understanding.

## 🎨 Visual System

| Dimension | What it means | How it’s shown |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Valence   | Pleasant ↔ Unpleasant | Hue (red ↔ grey ↔ teal) |
| Arousal   | Calm ↔ Excited | Saturation (pale ↔ vivid) |
| Dominance | Power/Control | Lightness (dark = low control, bright = high control) |

Heatmaps show where your states cluster over time.  
Plutchik-style “emotion anchors” let you snap to common states (joy, anger, trust, etc.).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack (MVP)

- 📊 **D3.js** for 2-D canvas + heatmap
- ⏱️ **WebWorkers** for smooth rendering
- 🎛️ **HTML/CSS/JS** for sliders & UI
- 🔒 **LocalStorage** for private saves

---

## 🚧 Roadmap

1️⃣ **Wireframe** basic sliders, dot, and anchors  
2️⃣ **Prototype** heatmap with dummy data (CSV)  
3️⃣ **Tune Mapping** — validate slider → emotion labels with test users  
4️⃣ **Add Playback** — basic scrubber to replay a session  
5️⃣ **Write Footnotes** — disclaimers & sources to explain “illustrative” nature

## ⚠️ Ethics & Boundaries

Iris is *not* a diagnostic tool.  
It’s an *interactive art–science mirror* for personal insight.  
No data leaves your device without clear consent.
